# Fury Demos

Examples demos for the WebGL game engine [Fury](https://github.com/delphic/Fury).

These demos use the 'old-school' approach of Fury as a separate standalone library.

More complicated code bases will probably wish to use Common JS / browserify.

Note in order to successfully run `sh build.sh` to regenerate the fury library you'll need to run `npm install` in the fury submodule.
